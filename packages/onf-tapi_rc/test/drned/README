How to run drned tests on onf-tapi_rc
--------------------------------

1. Install pytest and friends

   The installation process depends on your OS and version. If pip is
   available, the following should work. On debian clones, apt-get may
   be a better option.

   $ sudo pip install -U pytest
   $ sudo pip install -U pexpect
   $ sudo pip install -U lxml

2. Clone drned to a directory parallel to the NED

   $ git t-clone ssh://git@stash.tail-f.com/ned/drned.git

3. Goto drned directory

   $ cd <NED>/test/drned

4. In Makefile, check that the DRNED and NEDDIR variables are
   correct. Edit otherwise.

5. Load environment variables

   $ source <path-to-ncs-clone>/tailf/env.sh
   or
   $ source <path-to-ncs-installation>/ncsrc

   $ make env.sh && source env.sh

6. Start NCS and netsim

   $ make start

7. Run all tests

   $ make 10min 100min 1000min

8. Stop ncs and netsim

   $ make stop

9. Show all make targets

   $ make help
